# FINS3646 Project 2

This repository contains the scaffold and implementation for **FINS3646 Project 2**. The project was developed collaboratively by **Tom Greenhill**, **Swathi Shan**, **Nin Phu**, and **Driscoll**.

The primary focus of the project is to complete and submit the `project2_main.py` module as per the guidelines provided. The repository includes supporting files for testing and validation.

## Project Heirarchy

```
project2/                <- Project Repository
├── data/                <- Example data files for testing
│   ├── prc0.dat         <- <PRICE_DAT> example file
│   └── ret0.dat         <- <RET_DAT> example file
├── __init__.py          <- Initialization file
├── project2_main.py     <- Primary file to complete and submit
├── verify.py            <- Script to validate your code before submission
```

---

## Files

- **`data/`**: Contains the example data files `prc0.dat` and `ret0.dat` used for testing.
- **`__init__.py`**: Indicates that the `project2/` directory is a Python package.
- **`project2_main.py`**: The primary file for implementation. Only the sections marked with `# COMPLETE THIS PART` should be modified. This is the file to submit.
- **`verify.py`**: A utility script to verify your implementation for compliance with the guidelines before submission.

---

## Guidelines and Submission

1. **Development Environment**: Use PyCharm to develop your code. Ensure all modifications are limited to the `project2_main.py` file within the designated sections.
2. **File Submission**: Submit the `project2_main.py` file through the required platform (Ed).
3. **Validation**: Run the `verify.py` script before submission to ensure all requirements are met.
4. **Data Files**: Use the provided `prc0.dat` and `ret0.dat` files for testing. Note that your implementation should handle a variety of `.dat` files during evaluation.
5. **Prohibited Actions**:
   - Do not import additional modules or create new functions at the module level.
   - Avoid altering files other than `project2_main.py`.
